        <h2>Who We Are</h2>

        </p>

        <h2>Why Accurate Estimates Matter</h2>

        <ul class="about-points">
            <li>Good estimates save money by preventing overruns and unnecessary costs.</li>
            <li>Accurate estimating increases your bid-win probability and client confidence.</li>
            <li>Outsourcing estimation saves you time to focus on day-to-day operations.</li>
            <li>Professional estimating reduces the risk of budget surprises.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Help Contractors</h2>
        <p>
            Many contractors miss out on projects worth <strong>$300K–$600K per month</strong> simply 
            because they lack time to produce accurate bids. Working in the business leaves little 
            room to work on the business — and that’s where we step in.
        </p>

        <p>
            CostiQ Estimation is your one-stop partner for cost estimation, quantity takeoffs, and 
            professional bid preparation. We ensure bid-ready documents delivered fast with a proven 
            review process that eliminates guesswork.
