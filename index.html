<!-- ================= CONTRACTOR PAIN BUBBLE ================= -->

        <h1>Are You a Contractor?</h1>
        <h2>Too Busy Working IN the Business?</h2>

        <p>
            Most contractors spend their entire day running job sites,
            managing crews, handling calls, and chasing deadlines.
            This leaves almost no time to work <strong>ON</strong> the business.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because of this, many contractors unknowingly miss out on
            <strong>$300,000 to $400,000 worth of projects every month</strong>.
            Not due to lack of skill — but due to lack of time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Late bids, rushed estimates, or skipped opportunities
            slowly stop your business from growing,
            even when you are constantly busy.
        </p>

<!-- ================= WHY CONTRACTORS STRUGGLE ================= -->
<section class="about container">
    <h2>Why Most Contractors Struggle to Grow</h2>

    <p>
        In today’s competitive construction market, winning projects
        is no longer just about experience.
        It requires fast turnaround, accurate quantities,
        and competitive pricing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Contractors often lose bids because estimates are prepared in a hurry,
        submitted late, or lack proper detail.
        Many stop bidding altogether because estimating consumes
        too much valuable time.
    </p>

    <p>
        This creates a cycle where contractors stay busy —
        but never truly scale their business.
