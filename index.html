<!-- ================= CONTRACTOR PAIN BUBBLE ================= -->
<section class="contractor-bubble">
    <div class="bubble-card">
        <h1>Are You a Contractor?</h1>
        <h2>Too Busy Working IN the Business?</h2>

        <p>
            Most contractors spend their entire day running job sites,
            managing crews, handling calls, and chasing deadlines.
            This leaves almost no time to work <strong>ON</strong> the business.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because of this, many contractors unknowingly miss out on
            <strong>$300,000 to $400,000 worth of projects every month</strong>.
            Not due to lack of skill — but due to lack of time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Late bids, rushed estimates, or skipped opportunities
            slowly stop your business from growing,
            even when you are constantly busy.

<section class="contractor-insight">
    <h3>Why Most Contractors Struggle to Grow</h3>
    <p>In today’s competitive construction market, winning projects is no longer just about experience. It requires fast turnaround, accurate quantities, and competitive pricing.</p>
    <p>Contractors often lose bids because estimates are prepared in a hurry, submitted late, or lack proper detail. Many stop bidding altogether because estimating consumes too much valuable time.</p>
    <p>This creates a cycle where contractors stay busy — but never truly scale their business.</p>
</section>

<!-- ================= WHY OUTSOURCE ESTIMATION ================= -->
<section class="why-outsource container">
    <h2>Why You Should Outsource Construction Estimation</h2>

    <p>
        Construction estimating is tedious, time-consuming, and requires expertise.
        It’s not something that most contractors want to spend their time on.
        Without a correct estimate, you can end up spending much more than you planned
        or cutting too many corners to make your budget work.
    </p>

    <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li>Contractors are experts in their field. They need to focus on other aspects of the construction project.</li>
        <li>It can be difficult for contractors to estimate accurately without a background in estimating.</li>
        <li>Hiring an expert saves time and increases the accuracy of estimates.</li>
        <li>Outsourcing allows you to take on more projects and increase your profits.</li>
        <li>You will have more control over the budget, which decreases the risk of going over budget.</li>
